# React Fitness

React Fitness is a scheduling app that allows users to choose when they want to schedule their classes.
I built this to the demonstrate MVC & CRUD abilities for a booking application. Currently the application allows
users to create an account and book test sessions/classes from a dummy list of classes powered by a backend api.
User booked sessions are then retrieved from the api and displayed in a personalized user dashboard.
The front end client is built with React and back end api is built with Ruby.
This repo contains the front end React client.
